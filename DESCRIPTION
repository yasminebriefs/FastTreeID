Description: Implements the algorithm from the paper 'Faster Generic Identification in Tree-Shaped Structural Causal Models' by Briefs and Bläser, based on the approach of Gupta and Bläser in 'Identification for Tree-Shaped Structural Causal Models in Polynomial Time'. The package determines, for a structural causal model (SCM) whose directed edges form a tree, whether each parameter is unidentifiable, 1-identifiable or 2-identifiable (other cases cannot occur), using a randomized algorithm with provable running time O(n^3 log^2 n).
