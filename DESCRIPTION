Authors@R: c(person("Yasmine", "Briefs", email = "ybriefs@mpi-inf.mpg.de", role = c("aut", "cre")), person("Markus", "Bläser", email = "mblaeser@cs.uni-saarland.de", role = c("aut")))
Description: Implements the algorithm by Briefs and Bläser (2025) <https://openreview.net/forum?id=8PHOPPH35D>, based on the approach of Gupta and Bläser (2024) <doi:10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30023>. It determines, for a structural causal model (SCM) whose directed edges form a tree, whether each parameter is unidentifiable, 1-identifiable or 2-identifiable (other cases cannot occur), using a randomized algorithm with provable running time O(n^3 log^2 n).
